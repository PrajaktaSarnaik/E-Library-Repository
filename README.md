## UX (User Experience)

### Wireframes
Wireframes for all pages of the website were created before coding began. Versions for desktop, tablet and mobile size were created to reflect the responsive design expected. 

For the most part, the designs remained consistent with the implementation, but some changes were made - they will be shown and explained below.
