## Introduction
Logophile is a assessed portfolio project developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp, with the intention of demonstrating proficiency in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive website.

## Contents
The intention of this project was to create an interactive website for an online library which will allow users to create an account and borrow books. The books displayed are sorted by genre, with each genre containing an initial five books to choose from.


## UX (User Experience)

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to register an account, so that I can borrow books and access personalized features.
- As a user, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can easily find books of interest.
- As a user, I want to enquire about a specific book, so that I can get detailed information or request assistance regarding its availability.
- As a user, I want to rate and review books, so that I can share my feedback with others.
- As a user, I want to view my borrowed books and their due dates, so that I can manage my reading schedule.
- As a user, I want to receive notifications about my book return dates, so that I can return my books on time and avoid late fees.
- As a user, I want to borrow an e-book, so that I can read it online or download it.
- As a user, I want to bookmark specific pages of e-books, so that I can resume reading later.
- As a user, I want to receive personalized book recommendations, so that I can discover books Iâ€™d enjoy.

### Wireframes
Wireframes for all pages of the website were created before coding began. Versions for desktop, tablet and mobile size were created to reflect the responsive design expected. 

For the most part, the designs remained consistent with the implementation, but some changes were made - they will be shown and explained below.
